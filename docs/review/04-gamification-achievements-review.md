    for (const [id, check] of this.checks) {
      if (!this.isUnlocked(id) && check()) {
        unlocked.push(id);
      }
    }
    return unlocked;
  }
}

// ‚ùå BAD: Checking everything always
function checkAllAchievements() {
  // Checking all 100+ achievements on every action
  achievements.forEach(achievement => {
    // Heavy computation for each
  });
}
```

### Point Calculation
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Transparent calculation
interface PointBreakdown {
  base: number;
  bonuses: Array<{reason: string, points: number}>;
  multiplier: number;
  total: number;
}

const calculatePoints = (action: Action): PointBreakdown => {
  const breakdown = {
    base: getBasePoints(action),
    bonuses: getBonuses(action),
    multiplier: getMultiplier(user),
    total: 0
  };
  breakdown.total = (breakdown.base + 
    breakdown.bonuses.reduce((s, b) => s + b.points, 0)) *
