echo "📱 1. Start Metro console and wait for app to load"

echo "🗑️ 2. CHECK deletion cache status:"
echo "   moodDeletionCache.getStats()"
echo "   # Shows total records, expired records, user breakdown"

echo "🔍 3. CHECK recently deleted entries for user:"

echo "🧪 4. TEST deletion flow:"
echo "   1. Create a mood entry in the app"
echo "   2. Note the entry ID from logs"
echo "   3. Delete the entry via app UI"
echo "   4. Check deletion cache: moodDeletionCache.isRecentlyDeleted('ENTRY_ID')"

echo "⚡ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "   1. ✅ Entry deleted from UI immediately"
echo "   2. ✅ Entry marked in deletion cache"
echo "   3. ✅ IntelligentMerge filters deleted entries"
echo "   4. ✅ Entry stays deleted (no restore from remote)"
echo "   5. ✅ Deletion cache auto-expires after 7 days"

echo "🚨 IF STILL BROKEN:"
echo "   1. Check Metro logs for deletion cache messages"
echo "   2. Verify moodDeletionCache is loaded properly"
echo "   3. Check if IntelligentMerge filtering logs appear"
echo "   4. Test deletion cache commands manually"
