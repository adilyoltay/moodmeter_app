-- ===================================================================
-- Sync Consistency Check
-- Purpose: Compare Supabase vs LocalStorage mood entries count
-- Check if sync is working properly
-- ===================================================================

-- 1. Get total count in Supabase mood_entries
SELECT 
    'üìä SUPABASE MOOD_ENTRIES COUNT' as source,
    COUNT(*) as total_entries,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days') as last_7_days,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day') as last_24_hours,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE content_hash IS NOT NULL) as with_content_hash,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE triggers IS NOT NULL AND cardinality(triggers) > 0) as with_triggers,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activities IS NOT NULL AND cardinality(activities) > 0) as with_activities
FROM public.mood_entries;

-- 2. Get entries by user (to see distribution)
SELECT 
    'üë§ BY USER BREAKDOWN' as analysis,
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as entry_count,
    MIN(created_at) as first_entry,
    MAX(created_at) as last_entry,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE content_hash IS NOT NULL) as synced_entries,
    ROUND(AVG(mood_score)::numeric, 1) as avg_mood,
    ROUND(AVG(energy_level)::numeric, 1) as avg_energy,
    ROUND(AVG(anxiety_level)::numeric, 1) as avg_anxiety
FROM public.mood_entries 
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY entry_count DESC;

-- 3. Check for potential sync issues
SELECT 
    'üîç POTENTIAL SYNC ISSUES' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE content_hash IS NULL) as missing_content_hash,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE triggers IS NULL) as missing_triggers_array,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE activities IS NULL) as missing_activities_array,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at > updated_at) as inconsistent_timestamps,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE mood_score < 0 OR mood_score > 100) as invalid_mood_scores,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE energy_level < 1 OR energy_level > 10) as invalid_energy,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE anxiety_level < 1 OR anxiety_level > 10) as invalid_anxiety
FROM public.mood_entries;

-- 4. Show recent entries (what should be in localStorage)
SELECT 
    'üìÖ RECENT ENTRIES (SHOULD BE IN LOCALSTORAGE)' as info,
    id,
    user_id,
    mood_score,
    energy_level,
    anxiety_level,
    CASE 
        WHEN triggers IS NOT NULL AND cardinality(triggers) > 0 
        THEN CONCAT(cardinality(triggers), ' triggers')
        ELSE 'No triggers'
    END as triggers_info,
    CASE 
        WHEN content_hash IS NOT NULL THEN '‚úÖ Synced'
        ELSE '‚ùå Not synced'
    END as sync_status,
    created_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - created_at)) / 3600 as hours_ago
FROM public.mood_entries 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 5. Check for duplicates that might cause sync issues
SELECT 
    'üîÑ DUPLICATE CHECK' as check_type,
    user_id,
    content_hash,
    COUNT(*) as duplicate_count,
    STRING_AGG(id::text, ', ') as duplicate_ids,
    MIN(created_at) as first_created,
    MAX(created_at) as last_created
FROM public.mood_entries 
WHERE content_hash IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY user_id, content_hash 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
